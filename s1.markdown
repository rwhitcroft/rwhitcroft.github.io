# SentinelOne Agent Bypass
<hr/>

## What is this?
This is a write-up describing the discovery and exploitation of a vulnerability in SentinelOne ("S1").

<hr/>

## What is SentinelOne?
SentinelOne is a cybersecurity platform known for its robust Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities. It utilizes AI and machine learning to deliver real-time threat detection, automated response, and full visibility into endpoint activities.

SentinelOne is widely adopted across various industries due to its effectiveness in handling sophisticated attacks, ease of deployment, and comprehensive threat intelligence capabilities. Its ability to autonomously detect and respond to threats without manual intervention sets it apart as a leader in the EDR space.

## What is the vulnerability?
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability blinds the in-process detection, meaning you can run even the most toxic shellcode (e.g., meterpreter) without it getting detected. You can also remotely blind processes and inject into them, also without detection.

<hr/>

## How does the vulnerability work?
Whenever a new process is created, the kernel injects a DLL into it. This DLL is named `InProcessClient64.dll` on x64 systems and its purpose is to monitor the process for threats. It performs numerous timer- or event-driven tasks such as scanning memory for threats and watching for suspicious memory allocations and network connections.

If we use WinDbg to debug notepad.exe, we can see it loaded alongside all the other modules in the process:
```
0:000> lm
start             end                 module name
